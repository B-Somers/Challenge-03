# Random Password Generator

## Description

- This is a simple webpage allowing user to generate a random password using criteria they choose. Using a pop up asks users how many charitors they would like to have included in random password ( between 8-128 characters) also if they would like to include Uppercase, Lowercase, Symbols, and Numbers. User is allowed to use or decline any option they want. If none is sellected it will default to giving password in lowercase letters.

- my motivationo for this project was to get a solid understanding of how to use javascript in a real world use.

- i build this project to push my self past my comfort level of buildign small lines of code to a full project.

- this solves the problem of coming up with passwords and allows you to sellect your own criteria to use while coming up with a password.
